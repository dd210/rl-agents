# Implementation of RL algorithms

1. Value methods: Q-learning (Double Q-learning, Duelling, etc).
2. Policy gradient: Batch policy optimization (VanillaPG, TRPO).
3. Combination: Actor-Critic (AxC).

# To consider for implementation:

1. Exploration strategies.
2. PGQ.
3. AxC with experience replay.
